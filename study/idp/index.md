### SIMULINK auto-code generation for BeagleBoneBlack/Xenomai target

**At:** [Chair of Media Technology at Technische Universität München (TUM)](http://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/)

**Supervisor:** [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Eckehard Steinbach](http://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/en/team/team/eckehard-steinbach.html)

**Advisor:** [Rahul Chaudhari](http://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/en/team/alumni/rahul-chaudhari.html)

**Details:**
The Matlab/Simulink software provides a variety of standard signal processing algorithms implemented in the form of a Simulink-block library.
Program code can be automatically generated from a Simulink block diagram for specific target platforms.
At our institute, we have developed a haptic texture codec and implemented it in the form of a Simulink block diagram.
In order to deploy this codec between the sensor and actuator sides on the BBB, a Simulink interface needs to be
developed for auto-generating Xenomai code.
Moreover, so-called s-function interfaces (SIMULINK blocks) for the ADC and DAC sides need to be written.

Write what you acheived here and describe the diagram first.
