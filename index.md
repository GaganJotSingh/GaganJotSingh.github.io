A backend software engineer living in Munich with a passion for art and technology.
"Simplicity in programming and rigour in research" is my guiding principle.

I did Masters in Computer Science (Informatics, in German <span>&#9786;</span>) from the [Technical University of Munich, Germany](https://www.tum.de/){:target="_blank"} with a major in the area of "Algorithms and Scientific Computing".
My [Master's Thesis]({{ site.url_master_thesis }}) lies at the intersection of Distributed Systems and Algorithms.
Besides being interested in algorithmic challenges and problems in the area of distributed computing, I find Cryptography to be an intersting exploration.

When time allows <span>&#9787;</span>, I do the following:

* [Online courses]({{ site.url_courses_online }})
* [Text and media consumption]({{ site.url_my_reading_list }})
* Badminton, Biking, Chess
* Music

#### [My Resume]({{ site.url_resume }}) gives a little more information and for a formal resume please [write to me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Resume Request).
